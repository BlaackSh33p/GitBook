# Mouse Controls

### 🖱 Mouse Controls

* **Pan**:
  * Hold **mouse wheel (middle button)** → drag to move view.
* **Zoom (dynamic)**:
  * Scroll **mouse wheel** forward/backward.
* **Zoom to area**:
  * Type `Z` → Enter → `W` (window) → select an area.

***

### 📐 Zoom Commands (don’t rely only on scroll)

* `Z` → `E` → Enter = **Zoom Extents** (show entire drawing).
* `Z` → `A` → Enter = **Zoom All** (similar, but includes limits).
* `Z` → `P` = Zoom Previous (go back to last zoom level).

***

### 🖼 View Shortcuts

* Hold **Shift + mouse wheel** = Orbit (in 3D).
* Use **ViewCube** (top-right corner) to quickly switch standard views.
* Use **Navigation bar** (below ViewCube) → Pan, Zoom, Orbit tools.

***

### ⚡ Efficiency Tips

* Work with **layers** and **isolate objects** (LAYISO command) instead of zooming around.
* Use **Saved Views**:
  * Command: `VIEW` → Save a view of an area → restore later without zooming.
* Split into **layouts** (paper space) for plotting so you don’t always need to zoom model space.

***

👉 Best habit: **Scroll + Pan**, and when lost, hit `ZE` (Zoom Extents) to reset.
