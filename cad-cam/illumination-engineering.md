# Illumination engineering

Illumination engineering (or lighting design/engineering) is the science and art of providing adequate, comfortable, and efficient lighting in a space. It involves understanding how light interacts with a room, how much light people need for various tasks, and how to place luminaires (fittings) so that the space is well lit without glare, dark spots, or wasted energy.

Hereâ€™s a structured overview:

***

### ðŸ”¹ Basics of Illumination Engineering

1. **Key Terms**
   * **Lumen (lm):** Measure of luminous flux (total light output from a source).
   * **Lux (lx):** Illuminance = lumens per square meter. (How much light falls on a surface.)
   * **Watt (W):** Electrical power consumed by a lamp.
   * **Luminous efficacy:** Lumens per watt (lm/W), efficiency of a light source.
   * **Uniformity:** Evenness of light distribution across a room.
2. **Lighting Requirements (Lux Levels)**\
   Standards (like CIBSE, IES, or IS codes) specify recommended illuminance:
   * Corridors/stairways: 100â€“150 lux
   * Living rooms: 150â€“300 lux
   * Kitchens/reading areas: 300â€“500 lux
   * Offices/classrooms: 300â€“500 lux
   * Workshops/laboratories: 500â€“1000 lux

***

### ðŸ”¹ Steps to Lighting Design

#### 1. Calculate Required Lumens

$$\text Required Lumens=Room Area (mÂ²)Ã—Illuminance Level (lux)$$

Example: A 5 m Ã— 4 m room (20 mÂ²) used as an office, needing 300 lux:

$$20Ã—300=6000â€‰lumens needed$$

***

#### 2. Account for Room Factors

* **Utilization Factor (UF):** Fraction of light reaching the working plane (depends on fixture, room reflectance, layout).
* **Maintenance Factor (MF):** Accounts for lamp depreciation and dirt (usually 0.8).

So:

$${Total Lumens Required from Lamps} = \frac{\text{Required Lumens}}{UF \times MF}$$

If UF = 0.6 and MF = 0.8:

$$\frac{6000}{0.6 \times 0.8} = 12,500 \, \text{lumens}$$

***

#### 3. Select Number of Luminaires

If you choose LED panels with 3000 lumens each:

$$\frac{12,500}{3000} \approx 4.2$$

So, install **4â€“5 panels**.

***

#### 4. Placement of Fittings

* **Uniform Distribution:** Divide the ceiling evenly; spacing between lights should be about **1â€“1.5 times the mounting height above the working plane**.
* **Working Plane Height:** Usually 0.8 m (desk height) in offices, floor level for circulation spaces.
* **Room Index (RI):** Used to optimize layout.



$$RI=\frac{L \times W}{H_m \times (L + W)}$$



where Hmâ€‹ = mounting height above working plane.

* **General rules:**
  * Avoid placing lights too close to walls (<0.5 m).
  * For rectangular rooms, align lights in a grid.
  * In tall rooms, higher wattage or focused downlights may be needed.
  * For aesthetics, combine general lighting (ambient), task lighting, and accent lighting.

***

### ðŸ”¹ Example (Practical Case)

Room: 6 m Ã— 4 m Ã— 3 m height (office use)\
Target: 300 lux\
Area = 24 mÂ² â†’ Lumens = 24 Ã— 300 = 7200 lm\
With UF = 0.6, MF = 0.8 â†’ 7200 / (0.6 Ã— 0.8) â‰ˆ 15,000 lm\
LED panels = 3000 lm each â†’ Need 5 fixtures\
Placement: Arrange in a **grid of 2 Ã— 3**, evenly spaced, about 1â€“1.5 m away from walls.

### ðŸ”¹ Role of **Room Index (RI)**

The **Room Index** (RI) is a geometric factor used in lighting design. It helps determine the **Utilization Factor (UF)** of luminaires, which tells us how efficiently the light emitted by fixtures actually illuminates the working plane.

$$RI = \frac{L \times W}{H_m \times (L + W)}$$

* **L** = Room length (m)
* **W** = Room width (m)
* **Hâ‚˜** = Mounting height above working plane (ceiling height âˆ’ working plane height, usually desk height â‰ˆ 0.8 m)

ðŸ‘‰ Manufacturers provide tables where UF depends on RI and room surface reflectance. For example:

* **Low RI (<1):** Long narrow rooms, light doesnâ€™t distribute efficiently â†’ UF drops.
* **Medium RI (1â€“3):** Balanced rooms, good distribution â†’ UF higher.
* **High RI (>3):** Wide, shallow rooms, light reaches surfaces more effectively.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Gather the values

* Room **length (L)** = 6 m
* Room **width (W)** = 4 m
* Room **height** = 3 m
* Fittings are mounted at **2.8 m from the floor**
* **Working plane height** (office desks) â‰ˆ 0.8 m

So the **mounting height above working plane (Hm)** is:

Hm=2.8âˆ’0.8=2.0â€‰mH\_m = 2.8 - 0.8 = 2.0 \\, \text{m}Hmâ€‹=2.8âˆ’0.8=2.0m

***

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Formula for Room Index (RI)

RI=LÃ—WHmÃ—(L+W)RI = \frac{L \times W}{H\_m \times (L + W)}RI=Hmâ€‹Ã—(L+W)LÃ—Wâ€‹

***

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Plug in values

RI=6Ã—42.0Ã—(6+4)RI = \frac{6 \times 4}{2.0 \times (6 + 4)}RI=2.0Ã—(6+4)6Ã—4â€‹ RI=242.0Ã—10RI = \frac{24}{2.0 \times 10}RI=2.0Ã—1024â€‹ RI=2420=1.2RI = \frac{24}{20} = 1.2RI=2024â€‹=1.2

***

âœ… The **Room Index = 1.2**

This is a relatively **low RI**, which means the room is somewhat long/narrow relative to the mounting height. In practice, this suggests:

* Light distribution wonâ€™t be very efficient.
* The **Utilization Factor (UF)** might be around **0.45â€“0.55** (depending on reflectance of walls/ceiling).
* Fixtures should be arranged in a **grid (2 Ã— 2 or 2 Ã— 3)** to maintain uniformity.

## Summary (for UF choices typical around RI = 1.2)

* Required lumens at working plane: **7,200 lm** (24 mÂ² Ã— 300 lx).
* Adjusted lumens needed from fixtures = 7200UFÃ—MF\dfrac{7200}{UF \times MF}UFÃ—MF7200â€‹.

Concrete outcomes:

* **UF = 0.45** â†’ Adjusted lumens â‰ˆ **20,000 lm** â†’ **7 fittings** â†’ suggested layout **3 Ã— 3** (9 positions, using 7).
* **UF = 0.50** â†’ Adjusted lumens â‰ˆ **18,000 lm** â†’ **6 fittings** â†’ suggested layout **3 rows Ã— 2 cols**.
* **UF = 0.55** â†’ Adjusted lumens â‰ˆ **16,364 lm** â†’ **6 fittings** â†’ suggested layout **3 Ã— 2**.
* **UF = 0.60** â†’ Adjusted lumens â‰ˆ **15,000 lm** â†’ **5 fittings** â†’ suggested layout **2 Ã— 3**.

## Interpretation & recommendation

* Lower UF â†’ you need **more** fittings. RI = 1.2 is on the lower side, so expect UF to be **lower than a very compact room**; thatâ€™s why the number of fixtures can jump from 5 to 7 depending on UF.
* To pick the correct UF you should consult the **luminaire manufacturerâ€™s UF tables** (they list UF vs RI for different ceiling/wall reflectances). If you want, I can:
  * add a manufacturer-style UF lookup table to the calculator and pick a UF based on typical reflectances (ceiling 70%, walls 50%, floor 20%),
  * or re-run with a different luminaire lumen value (e.g., 2400 lm or 4000 lm) or a different target lux.
* For layout: aim for a **regular grid** centred in the room. Keep spacing roughly **1â€“1.5 Ã— Hm** between fittings and about **0.5â€“1 Ã— Hm** from walls to avoid dark edges.
