# Aesthetics of Your PCB Designs

## How to Improve the Aesthetics of Your PCB Designs (Without Compromising Functionality)

In most PCB design workflows, the primary focus is understandably on function — signal integrity, power delivery, EMI performance, manufacturability, and reliability. But what about aesthetics? Can a PCB be _beautiful_ — and does that even matter?

In this article, we’ll explore **why aesthetics in PCB design** can matter more than you think — especially when it comes to **usability, manufacturability, branding, and visual clarity**. Drawing from real-world examples and lessons learned from previous designs, we’ll also go over practical tips you can apply today to make your PCB designs cleaner, more professional-looking, and easier to use.

***

### Why PCB Aesthetics Matter (Sometimes More Than You Think)

Before we dive into techniques, let’s address the obvious: in most products, the PCB is hidden from the end user. So, is aesthetics even worth the effort?

#### Yes — and here’s why:

* **Manufacturability**: Clean layouts reduce assembly errors and improve test coverage.
* **Debugging and Testing**: Well-organized boards are easier to probe and troubleshoot.
* **User-friendliness**: Clearly labeled headers and logical component placement make developer boards easier to use.
* **Professionalism**: If you’re showing your board to clients, recruiters, or on a portfolio — visual appeal _does_ matter.
* **Marketing & Branding**: Visually distinctive PCBs stand out, especially for dev kits or demo units.

> Of course, aesthetics should never come at the cost of functionality, cost, or time to market. But done right, it can be the difference between a design that _works_ and a design that _wows_.

### What Makes a PCB Aesthetic?

Aesthetic design isn’t about adding unnecessary elements — it’s about _clarity_, _consistency_, and _thoughtful layout_. Let’s look at key factors and tips:

***

### 1. Use a Consistent and Sensible Grid

Using a structured placement grid improves alignment, spacing, and trace routing.

**Tips:**

* Avoid placing parts off-grid — it breaks symmetry and increases visual clutter.
* Use a moderate grid (e.g., 0.25 mm) for part placement.
* Avoid overly tight placement; give parts breathing space while maintaining proximity where needed.
* Group similar parts (resistor banks, decoupling caps) in straight, aligned rows.

***

### 2. Partition Your Board Logically

Good design separates analog, digital, power, and RF sections. This improves both performance and aesthetics.

**Example partitioning:**

* Digital signals bottom left
* Analog top right
* Power top left
* Control interfaces bottom edge

This makes routing easier, testing simpler, and the board more visually intuitive.

***

### 3. Thoughtful Trace Routing

Messy routing can instantly make a design look amateurish — and function poorly.

**Best practices:**

* Maintain even spacing between parallel traces (especially for buses or differential pairs).
* Route into pads _centrally_ when possible to avoid sharp angles or acid traps.
* Avoid "necking down" traces unnecessarily.
* Use **teardrops** for vias and pad transitions where appropriate.
* Keep trace entries clean, especially for fine-pitch devices.

***

### 4. Optimize Silkscreen Placement

Clear, non-overlapping silkscreen contributes to both looks and usability.

**Recommendations:**

* Don’t place silkscreen over vias or exposed copper.
* Label connectors clearly (e.g., "UART IN", "SCL", "SDA").
* Use consistent fonts and sizes — minimum 1.5 mm text height is a good rule.
* Consider **inverted labels** (white text on a filled box) for highlighting key areas.
* Include useful info: board version, test checkboxes, logo, designer initials, manufacturing date, etc.

***

### 5. Choose a Suitable Surface Finish and Solder Mask Color

Choosing a different **solder mask color** or **surface finish** can dramatically affect how your PCB looks — and how it performs.

**Popular options:**

* **Matte Black + Yellow Silkscreen**: Sleek, modern look. Great for dev boards.
* **ENIG (Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold)**: Excellent for flat pads and long shelf life.
* **Matte Blue / White / Red**: Aesthetic variants that can match brand colors.
* **Green**: Still the industry standard — cheap and functional.

Just keep in mind that:

* Exotic solder masks may increase cost or affect minimum trace/spacing rules.
* ENIG is more expensive than HASL but has functional benefits for fine-pitch and SMT.

***

### 6. Round Off PCB Corners

Rounded corners not only look better but are more practical for manufacturing.

**Why it matters:**

* Most PCBs are milled — sharp corners aren’t ideal and will be rounded by the fab anyway.
* Rounded edges prevent wear on cables, enclosures, or handling gloves.
* Makes the board look polished — literally.

***

### 7. Keep the Enclosure in Mind

If the board goes into an enclosure, **design for the enclosure** — don’t just adapt after the fact.

**Tips:**

* Place connectors and mechanical components (LEDs, switches) symmetrically and aligned with enclosure cutouts.
* Use metric or imperial round numbers (e.g., 10.0 mm, not 10.125 mm) for alignment.
* Collaborate with mechanical designers early.

***

### 8. Add Branding and Production Info

A clean board with no logo or version info is a missed opportunity.

**Consider adding:**

* Your personal or company logo
* Board name and version (e.g., DSP-BRD-V1.2)
* Manufacturing date
* Test box or check area for QA
* Serial number space for production runs

This improves traceability and shows pride in your work.

### Aesthetics That Serve a Purpose

Many aesthetic improvements also deliver functional benefits. For example:

| Aesthetic Feature         | Functional Benefit                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistent grid placement | Easier routing, better pick-and-place accuracy    |
| Partitioned sections      | Improved EMI, easier debugging                    |
| Clean silkscreen          | Faster assembly, lower soldering errors           |
| Rounded corners           | Better fit in enclosures, safer handling          |
| Teardrops and spacing     | Improved signal integrity, easier probing/testing |

### Bonus: Manufacturer Support

In the video this article is based on, all modern PCBs shown were **manufactured and assembled by PCBWay**, a Chinese PCB manufacturer offering a wide range of customization, including:

* HDI boards
* Up to 60 layers
* Controlled impedance
* Flexible solder mask and silkscreen options

They also support advanced finishes like ENIG, edge plating, and custom stackups — great for both aesthetics and performance.

You can use the coupon **PCBWAY-FILLSLAB** (linked in the original video) for a discount if you want to try their services.

### Final Thoughts

Aesthetic PCB design isn't about showing off — it's about **thoughtful, professional craftsmanship**. While function and reliability are always top priorities, taking the extra time to refine the visual aspects of your board can pay dividends in:

* Usability
* Assembly
* Debugging
* Marketing
* Personal satisfaction

Start small: clean up silkscreen, align your parts, and avoid messy routing. Over time, these habits will become second nature, and your PCBs will not only work well — they’ll _look_ like they were designed by someone who cares.
